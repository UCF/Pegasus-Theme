          <p>
            <span>Because the line at the coffee shop</span>
            <span>was long, and the castoff</span>
            <span>lover behind me chanted a breakup saga</span>
            <span>into her cellphone, all the details laid out</span>
            <span>like ancient scarabs on velvet.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>Because in a dream my long-gone</span>
            <span>Granny walked next to me</span>
            <span>in the surf eating fried chicken,</span>
            <span>lofting bits to gulls above and fish</span>
            <span>below, water swirling its mirrored sky</span>
            <span>at our knees. She warned</span>
            <span>of deep weather; we could smell</span>
            <span>the dark salt in the Atlantic</span>
            <span>and warm black inner tubes,</span>
            <span>while babies that were mine but not mine</span>
            <span>floated by, impossible to catch and keep.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>Because as a girl I wanted not to be,</span>
            <span>but to have (a farm with horses and collies).</span>
            <span>Because it turns out there are too many</span>
            <span>lives to live, and only enough time</span>
            <span>and money for one.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>Because this is the only way to set things right,</span>
            <span>or down, or free, or on fire,</span>
            <span>depending on the story. Because</span>
            <span>my parents' voices still sing in my head.</span>
            <span>Their days of worry and joy</span>
            <span>weave into my own</span>
            <span>like flickering reels of truth on the</span>
            <span>decorated walls of memory.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>Because when I drank the words</span>
            <span>of Keats for the first time, I wept</span>
            <span>in the public square</span>
            <span>of adolescence, a wooden</span>
            <span>desk in the third row</span>
            <span>where I carved "nightingale."</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>Because the teacher saw the shutters</span>
            <span>behind my eyes bang open,</span>
            <span>and for a moment we were ageless</span>
            <span>together. Because poetry can vanquish</span>
            <span>shame, make it into a box</span>
            <span>of air to stand on.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>Because the stories will be told -</span>
            <span>betrayals turned to moss and leaves,</span>
            <span>griefs spun to gold.</span>
          </p>
