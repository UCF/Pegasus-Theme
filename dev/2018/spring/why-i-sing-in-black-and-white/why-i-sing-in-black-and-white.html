            Because the line at the coffee shop
            was long, and the castoff
            lover behind me chanted a breakup saga
            into her cellphone, all the details laid out
            like ancient scarabs on velvet.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because in a dream my long-gone
            Granny walked next to me
            in the surf eating fried chicken,
            lofting bits to gulls above and fish
            below, water swirling its mirrored sky
            at our knees. She warned
            of deep weather; we could smell
            the dark salt in the Atlantic
            and warm black inner tubes,
            while babies that were mine but not mine
            floated by, impossible to catch and keep.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because as a girl I wanted not to be,
            but to have (a farm with horses and collies).
            Because it turns out there are too many
            lives to live, and only enough time
            and money for one.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because this is the only way to set things right,
            or down, or free, or on fire,
            depending on the story. Because
            my parents' voices still sing in my head.
            Their days of worry and joy
            weave into my own
            like flickering reels of truth on the
            decorated walls of memory.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because when I drank the words
            of Keats for the first time, I wept
            in the public square
            of adolescence, a wooden
            desk in the third row
            where I carved "nightingale."
          </p>

          <p>
            Because the teacher saw the shutters
            behind my eyes bang open,
            and for a moment we were ageless
            together. Because poetry can vanquish
            shame, make it into a box
            of air to stand on.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because the stories will be told -
            betrayals turned to moss and leaves,
            griefs spun to gold.
          </p>
