        <p><span class="firstletter">D</span>enver Severt knows that hospitals can offer drastically different types of care. His 3-day-old son, Noah, spent his short life in two facilities whose care was so contradictory that Severt was compelled to apply his knowledge of hospitality management to patient care.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;At the first hospital, Noah was having trouble breathing. A nurse came in and asked us his name, claiming a file had been misplaced. Four hours later the nurse returned, asked his name again, took out a pen, and wrote our son&rsquo;s name on her hand. It made for a frustrating, traumatic experience,&rdquo; says Severt.</p>

        <p>Noah passed away from hypoplastic left heart syndrome at the second hospital. It was this hospital&rsquo;s extraordinary service that motivates Severt today.</p>

        <p>He refers to the compassion demonstrated by the neonatal intensive care unit physician as &ldquo;the best service encounter of my life.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;The medical outcome can be bad, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean the service to the patient has to be compromised."</p>

        <p>Now Severt, an associate professor at UCF&rsquo;s Rosen College of Hospitality Management, assists hospitals in researching how they administer service, from a patient&rsquo;s admission to their discharge from a facility. The studies are conducted to help hospitals improve satisfaction scores, which the government reviews for Medicare reimbursements.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;We did an emergency department study on the flow of patients. We learned that hospitals are sophisticated but fragmented entities," he says. &ldquo;The management is separate from the nurses, volunteers and physicians.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The studies aid hospitals in breaking down communication barriers between nurses, physicians, hospital management and employees, and help all of the independent professionals to work as a unit.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Improvement can come by making everyone&rsquo;s job more efficient, by transferring medical records properly, or simply by spending more time listening to patient needs,&rdquo; says Severt.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;In a hedonistic business like leisure, the guests want to be there. No one wants to be a guest at a hospital,&rdquo; Severt says. &ldquo;But a bed is a bed, and patients compare them. It&rsquo;s the consumer-based nature of our society.&rdquo; &#10022;</p>
