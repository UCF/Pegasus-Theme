					<h3>Christopher Frye</h3>
					<h4>On Research</h4>
					<p>
						This particular project investigated how string theory modifies Einstein’s theory of general relativity and, in particular, the effects on phenomena in our own solar system. String theory is an attempt to explain all phenomena that occurs in our universe; thus it must include a theory of gravity. In my research, I calculate the effects these “stringy” equations would have on what we should observe in the classical tests of general relativity.
					</p>
					<h4>On Collaboration</h4>
					<p>
						I am most interested in the theoretical areas of physics, and I was thrilled when my adviser suggested a research topic that would allow me to learn string theory.
					</p>
					<h4>On Challenges</h4>
					<p>
						Calculations in general relativity are almost always computationally demanding, and I did this work by hand. There were a lot of chances for careless errors that could become dangerous if not caught.
					</p>
					<h4>On the Importance of Student Research</h4>
					<p>
						Research experience allows students to determine whether they might prefer a career in academics or in industry, and it also helps a great deal when applying for graduate school and jobs.
					</p>
					<h4>On Working With Dr. Efthimiou</h4>
					<p>
						Dr. Efthimiou believes that learning a subject deeply requires a large amount of pain and suffering, even if one is very interested in what he studies, but the reward is great.

					<h3>Dr. Costas Efthimiou</h3>
					<h4>On Your Decision to Become a Scientist</h4>
					<p>
						My academic strengths have always been mathematics and physics, so it was natural to pick an area of concentration that allows me to practice both.
					</p>
					<h4>On Your Role at UCF</h4>
					<p>
						Supervising undergraduate students has always been one of my strengths, especially helping them to study advanced material in my area of concentration — theoretical high energy physics. I have learned to be very effective, and my students have won many competitive awards.
					</p>
					<h4>On The Importance of This Research</h4>
					<p>
						This work is just one piece in a grand theory known as string theory, which has been proposed as the Theory of Everything (TOE). The TOE is a dream of physicists; a unique theory that can explain any phenomenon taking place in our universe — past, present or future. Through research such as ours, we can propose many tests that can (in principle) verify the theory. Eventually, some of these tests will be feasible, and we’ll know if string theory is the TOE.
					</p>
					<h4>On Working With Chris</h4>
					<p>
						This project would stress the abilities of most graduate students. Chris’ intellectual abilities, great mathematical skills and conscientiousness allowed him to become an independent researcher quickly.

					<h3>Dr. Steven Berman</h3>
					<h4>On Your Role at UCF</h4>
					<p>
						When I came to UCF, Dr. Alvin Wang invited me to serve as the Daytona Beach campus coordinator for our Honors in the Major students. Mentoring student researchers is my favorite part of my job.
					</p>
					<h4>On Your Decision to Become a Researcher</h4>
					<p>
						As a psychotherapist, I helped one person at a time. As a researcher, I am able to develop intervention programs that serve many people.
					</p>
					<h4>On Advising Aspiring Student Researchers</h4>
					<p>
						Choose a mentor that is successful in publishing their research and is willing to spend time nurturing their mentees.
					</p>
					<h4>On the Importance of This Research</h4>
					<p>
						This project examines the role of parenting in helping teenagers form their sense of identity. A better understanding of these relationships will help us in developing intervention and prevention programs aimed at fostering positive youth development.
					</p>
					<h4>On Working With Kaylin</h4>
					<p>
						Kaylin is one of the most diligent, driven and hardworking students I have ever met. In our project together, Kaylin and I found that one of the widely used measures in our field has some conceptual problems, which was an important discovery. She has taught me to have more trust in my undergraduates.

					<h3>Kaylin Ratner</h3>
					<h4>On Research</h4>
					<p>
						Identity style is how adolescents process incoming identity-relevant information and use it to form their personal code (the roles, goals and values that will give their life direction and purpose). This study set out to determine if an adolescent’s identity style could be predicted by the parenting style by which they were raised, and by the degree of attachment to which they felt toward their parents.
					</p>
					<h4>On Applying Research to the Real World</h4>
					<p>
						This research is applicable outside of the lab by way of family therapy, which can emphasize the importance of supportive behavior in the parent-child relationship, leading to psychological well-being.
					</p>
					<h4>On Challenges</h4>
					<p>
						I had two major learning curves: First, I had to learn how to write in a professional genre. Second, I had to learn graduate-level statistics in a matter of two or three months.
					</p>
					<h4>On the Importance of Student Research</h4>
					<p>
						Participating in research has better prepared me for graduate school. It has also given me the opportunity to network with faculty members and other professionals within my area of research.
					</p>
					<h4>On Working With Dr. Berman</h4>
					<p>
						Ironically enough, I think working with Dr. Berman helped me solidify my identity. I always knew that I loved the study of psychology, but I feel as if I have found my niche since beginning this research project.

					<h3>Moses Murdock</h3>
					<h4>On Research</h4>
					<p>
						Every day, humans encounter silver in its many forms, and while silver is a known antimicrobial, how it interacts with human cells is not fully understood. Metals similar to silver (e.g., gold and platinum) are known to inhibit human enzymes, and have been exploited for therapeutic use against diseases as diverse as rheumatoid arthritis to cancer. My research with Dr. Self focused on understanding the details of silver’s ability to inhibit two human enzymes.
					</p>
					<h4>On Challenges</h4>
					<p>
						At the outset of any research project, there can be a rather intimidating learning curve. Mastering new techniques and grappling with complex terminology was the most difficult obstacle for this project.
					</p>
					<h4>On Collaboration</h4>
					<p>
						There is no better experience than coming up with a crazy idea for an experiment, discussing it with my mentor, and then planning and carrying it out.
					</p>
					<h4>On the Importance of Student Research</h4>
					<p>
						Research brings the concepts learned in the classroom to life. It changes the way you think: Facts are no longer considered absolute and rigid; they are subject to critical analysis. Most importantly, research provides the opportunity for students to interact with and learn from professors who are experts in their field.
					</p>
					<h4>On Working With Dr. Self</h4>
					<p>
						Dr. Self is very open to consultation. His strong work ethic inspires and motivates me because he has invested so much in me as a person and in my projects.

					<h3>Dr. William Self</h3>
					<h4>On Your Decision to Become a Scientist</h4>
					<p>
						The biggest push for me to become a scientist was my undergraduate research experience at the University of Florida. I also credit a ninth-grade chemistry teacher with giving me an interest in science that paved the way for my career.
					</p>
					<h4>On Your Role at UCF</h4>
					<p>
						In addition to teaching Microbial Metabolism to undergrads, I lead an active research laboratory where I mentor undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral fellow. My laboratory studies the trafficking and metabolism of a variety of metals and metalloids.
					</p>
					<h4>On Advising Aspiring Student Researchers</h4>
					<p>
						No matter how difficult the problem, stick with the fundamentals. Hard work, thoughtful use of the scientific method and a careful experimental design with lots of controls can usually overcome any obstacle.
					</p>
					<h4>On Working With Moses</h4>
					<p>
						Moses’ accomplishments are on par with the top students at the best universities in the U.S. This gives me confidence that our biomedical sciences program is strong.
