            <p>It took just 15 minutes for Alan Eustace, '79, to skydive from the edge of space and into the record book for the highest free-fall parachute jump. In October Google's senior vice president of knowledge was tethered to a helium-filled balloon at a remote airstrip in Roswell, New Mexico. He floated to a height of 135,890 feet before plunging back to Earth in a specially designed space suit at speeds topping 822 miles per hour, generating a sonic boom.</p>

            <p>A life-sized diorama immerses visitors in an ancient tomb discovered by UCF archaeologists Diane and Arlen Chase at “Maya: Hidden Worlds Revealed,” a traveling exhibit currently showing at Boston’s Museum of Science. The recreation of the tomb of the Great Scrolled Skull at Santa Rita Corozal in Belize is designed to look exactly how it did when the husband-and-wife team first opened it and includes artifacts such as an intricate jade, shell and obsidian mask that the ruler likely wore as an ornament on his belt or necklace. Another exhibit features a 3-D map of the Maya city of Caracol, which the Chases created using laser remote sensing technology to discover ancient agricultural terraces, roads and structures covered by thick jungle. The exhibit, which runs in Boston through May 3, continues at the San Diego Natural History Museum, June 12 to Jan. 3, 2016. </p>

            <p>Researchers at UCF’s College of Optics and Photonics and their partners at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands have developed a new type of fiber optic cable that enables a record-breaking data transmission of 255 terabits per second. That’s approximately 21 percent more bandwidth than current communication networks allow.</p>

          <p>In December Mike Chen, chief strategy officer of Made in Space — a company co-founded by Jason Dunn, '07 (see <a href="/pegasus/spring-2014/">Pegasus Spring 2014</a>) — overheard International Space Station Commander Barry Wilmore express the need for a specialized ratcheting wrench during a radio communication. In response, Made in Space emailed design instructions to their <a href="/pegasus/jason-dunn-3d-printing-international-space-station/">onboard zero-gravity 3-D printer</a>, which printed the wrench in four hours. It was one of 20 objects built by the 3-D printer on its maiden voyage aboard the station.</p>

          <p>The John C. Hitt Library will be implementing a robotic librarian, allowing students, faculty and alumni to benefit from advancing technology. Housed in a four-story addition to the north side of the building, the automated retrieval center will offer self-serve access to 1.2 million print volumes via a mechanical arm that delivers books in minutes. Preliminary construction is scheduled to begin this year</p>
