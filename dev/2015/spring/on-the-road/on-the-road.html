				<p class="lead">Walking out of a southern California airport after his first-ever plane flight, junior Johnathan Allen didn’t know what to expect. The first-generation college student from Winter Haven, Florida, had volunteered for a <a href="http://roadtripnation.com/roadtrip/first-gen-roadtrip" target="_blank">PBS series called “Roadtrip Nation.”</a> Along the five-week, 4,000-mile journey from Los Angeles to New York, the cast interviewed a diverse group of leaders &mdash; from CEOs to Grammy-winning musicians &mdash; all of whom were also the first in their families to attend college. The trip challenged Allen, 21, to overcome his fears and achieve personal milestones, including bungee jumping, driving a massive recreational vehicle and learning to live with strangers. But the biggest lessons came from the interviews. Here are the highlights of Allen’s road to self-discovery.</p>

Her story of overcoming so many problems growing up reminded me of my own experiences. She made me stop and think that there are people out there who have been through a lot worse than me. She broke down on camera, and to me, showing that weakness is what makes her the leader she is. She’s not a CEO, but she has the same skillset to be successful in a role like that."</p>

He said, 'Take away the title, take away the job, and we’re all the same.' He grew up in the Bronx and it was rough for him. &hellip; That was an eye-opener because it made me believe that even with my background, I could one day be a CEO.

He's a smart guy. He went to college at 16, graduated at 20 and actually did music as a gig at night. His advice was to follow your own road in life, and don't let others turn you away from what you want to do. He was also one of those people with a big title, big name, who was very human."</p>
