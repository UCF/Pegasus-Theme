          <h2>Alumni support student victims of apartment fire.</h2>
          <p>
            When a three-alarm blaze ripped through Tivoli Apartments July 12 destroying 24 units and displacing approximately 25 UCF students, Knights alumni responded with 353 donations totaling $32,448 in cash gifts. Food, clothing and other essentials were also received by the Knights Helping Knights Pantry, including 14 laptop computers donated by Ken Brown, ’02, managing director of the Orlando-based IT staffing company Tekk Fusion.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I looked at [the computers] and thought, 'Those kids need these more than we do right now,'" says Brown. In the aftermath of the fire, UCF offered temporary housing to those who needed it, along with assistance for other challenges such as lost textbooks or passports.
