      <div class="intro">
        <p><span>The Red Planet</span> is a frigid, hostile environment, but for Kelly Lai, '15, it's a paradise &mdash; for revenge. And like the plot of a science fiction movie, the UCF aerospace engineer has created a robot to do her bidding in a personal redemption quest at the NASA Robotic Mining Competition.</p>

        <p class="lead copy">In 2014, Lai was part of UCF&rsquo;s first team to compete in the annual contest, which challenges teams around the country to create remote-controlled mining machines. But a complete mechanical failure prevented them from competing. &ldquo;I was so upset because a lot of the judges were NASA engineers who graduated from UCF, and they actually called us the home team,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Failing was heartbreaking, so I came back with a vengeance.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="copy">For the 2015 competition, which took place May 18–22 at Kennedy Space Center, Lai hand-picked a multidisciplinary team with expertise from engineering to marketing and accounting, and spent nearly a year designing and building a new machine. Unfortunately, a communications glitch fouled their final run, but a new UCF team will return in 2016 &mdash; and Lai will continue to follow her personal calling to the stars. </p>
        <blockquote>&ldquo;My passion is space exploration,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;To produce a robot that can mine [materials] to create water or make soil for plants to help sustain life on Mars &mdash; that&rsquo;s what I live for.&rdquo;</blockquote>

          <h2>The Competition</h2>
          <p>From an enclosed control room, remote operators have 10 minutes to navigate a closed course and gather at least 10 kilograms of basaltic regolith simulant (ash) and icy regolith simulant (gravel) to be deposited into a collection bin. Other competition categories include a systems engineering paper, a slide presentation and demonstration, an outreach project promoting STEM education to schoolchildren, and team spirit. The team that collects the most material and earns the most category points wins.</p>

        <p>The pilot uses a laptop computer to drive the robot and activate drilling and dumping mechanisms via a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3 data-elevation-image="[image filename='elevation1.png']">1 Power source</h3>
        <p>A lithium iron phosphate motorcycle battery &mdash; routed through a distribution board that uses fuses to feed appropriate voltage to each motor &mdash; provides enough power to run all electrical systems.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3 data-elevation-image="[image filename='elevation2.png']">2 Electronics housing</h3>
        <p>A polycarbonate box sealed with a rubber gasket protects sensitive electronics from penetrating ash that can foul the delicate instruments. Inside, a BeagleBone Black circuit board uses microcontrollers to run all systems.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3 data-elevation-image="[image filename='elevation3.png']">3 Actuator system</h3>
        <p>A scissor jack system powered by a linear actuator moves the drill and hopper assembly up and down to control ground clearance, drilling depth and dumping into the collection bin.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3 data-elevation-image="[image filename='elevation4.png']">4 Wheels</h3>
        <p>At 8 inches in diameter and 2 inches wide, the rubber-treaded VEX Robotics wheels create enough traction to move the robot through soft ash. Each wheel is powered independently by a dedicated CIM motor, allowing the pilot to maneuver the fixed wheel with a skid-steering technique.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3 data-elevation-image="[image filename='elevation5.png']">5 Drill</h3>
        <p>Powered by an electric motor, a rotating, 4-inch diameter steel auger used commercially to drill postholes penetrates the layer of ash to mine the high-value gravel beneath. A PVC housing helps to carry the material up and into the collection hopper.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3 data-elevation-image="[image filename='elevation6.png']">6 Hopper</h3>
        <p>Made from aluminum sheet metal with a polycarbonate lid and sides, this triangular collection bin uses gravity to assist the removal of excavated material through a rear dump door operated by a remote-controlled motor. An LED light array signals green while mining until a red light indicates full capacity.</p>
