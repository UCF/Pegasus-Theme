                        <p>Special Collections and University Archives Senior Archivists Burak Ogreten and Sandra Varry display a Spanish antiphonary, for a choir of the Divine Office of the Catholic Church, dating ca. 1520-1560. The antiphonary includes Latin chant notation on red staves, decorated capitals in red and blue ink, and strapwork capitals in black ink with yellow wash. Its wood binding is covered in cowhide with brass corners and inset studs. This beautiful manuscript was acquired in 2010 as a gift from Sylvia Semel of Maitland, Fla.</p>

                    <p>Collection Manager Shawn Kelly holds a Goliath beetle (Goliathus goliatus) from equatorial Africa. Considered the world’s heaviest insect, it is part of UCF’s Stuart M. Fullerton Collection of Arthropods, which contains specimens from around the globe. The collection is best known, however, as the largest insect collection in the world focusing specifically on Central Florida. Says Curator Dr. Hojun Song, “Central Florida is a biogeographically interesting area and a global hot spot for biodiversity, all of which make our insect collection big.” <strong>Click on the arrow below to see more big bugs.</strong></p>
