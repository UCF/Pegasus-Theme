                    <p>The world’s shortest laser pulse — created by physics professor Zenghu Chang — may get up to six times faster thanks to a new five-year, $7.5 million grant. “Dr. Chang’s success in making ever-shorter light pulses helps open a new door to a previously hidden world, where we can watch electrons move in atoms and molecules, and follow chemical reactions as they take place,” said Michael Johnson, physicist and dean of the UCF College of Sciences. To equal a full second, Chang would have to repeat his 67-attosecond pulse experiment 15 million billion times.</p>

                    <p>Eight UCF students successfully defended a small (and fictitious) business from electronic attacks to win the Raytheon National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition. “The team’s strength lies in their teamwork, cross-training, and dedication to continue learning and improving,” says Thomas Nedorost, faculty sponsor from the College of Engineering and Computer Science. The UCF team had its photo displayed in Times Square in recognition of its excellence.</p>

                    <p>The Knights paintball team won the 2014 NCPA Collegiate Xball  National Championships. The 11-member UCF team swept their competition and beat the University of Connecticut Huskies for the title. “Being our first year in Class A, we were excited to see how we stacked up against the rest of the country,” says team president Zak Daughtry. “We’re very fortunate to have a solid roster of experienced players.”</p>

                    <p>Matt Prater’s 64-yard field goal broke a 43-year-old NFL record in 2013. The Denver Broncos kicker still holds several kicking and punting records at UCF. His shoes are now in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. “Some of my favorite artifacts are the ones that still have all the mud and bloodstains on them,” says collections curator Jason Aikens.</p>

The award-winning annual publication features short fiction, poetry, literary nonfiction and art. “When I went up for tenure in 1989, Provost Richard Astro asked, ‘Is there anything the university could be doing to improve your department?’ ” Professor Don Stap remembers. “I [replied], ‘We could use a good student literary journal.’ ” After finding out it had been approved, Stap says, “I was shocked. It was terrific.”</p>
