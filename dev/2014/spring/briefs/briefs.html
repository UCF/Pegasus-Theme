                    <h3>Reaching for the Stars — and Asteroids and Moons</h3>
                    <p>Thanks to a $6 million NASA grant awarded to physics professor Daniel Britt, UCF will be establishing the Center for Lunar and Asteroid Surface Science (CLASS), a hub of research investigating the physical properties of celestial bodies. Part of NASA’s new Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute, CLASS will join eight other research teams around the country in a collaborative partnership to further space science. “This makes UCF a leader in the area of solar system exploration, and CLASS makes Central Florida integral to NASA’s exploration future,” Britt says.</p>

                    <p>“The best athletes keep a diary of their food intake,” says UCF Associate Professor Jeffrey Stout, recently named the William J. Kraemer Outstanding Sport Scientist of the Year by the National Strength and Conditioning Association. The director of the Human Performance Lab at UCF’s Institute of Exercise Physiology and Wellness also advises writing down how you felt after each meal. “Did you have a lot of energy? Did you feel bloated? This is important because you want to identify those foods that agree with you.” And with what type of treats does Stout reward himself and his family? “Fresh fruit — apples, bananas and oranges for adults and children,” he says.</p>

                    <p>UCF graduate research professor Peter Kincaid has collected antique writing instruments for more than 30 years, and he’s donated a portion of his collection to create “The Art of Fountain Pens,” a new exhibit at The Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art in Winter Park, Fla. “I’ve always been interested in the combination of art and technology,” says the co-director of the modeling and simulation graduate program. The exhibition features more than a hundred fountain pens and advertisements dating back to 1875.</p>

Their debut album for Sony Music is scheduled for release this summer.</p>
