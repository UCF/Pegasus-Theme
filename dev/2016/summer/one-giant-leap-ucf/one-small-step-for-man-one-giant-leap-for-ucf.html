							<h1>One Small Step for Man,<br />One Giant Leap for UCF</h1>
							<p>UCF has been committed to space exploration since before man’s first step on the moon.</p>

							<p>Ever notice how the street names on campus represent constellations, galaxies and spacecraft? Gemini Boulevard, Andromeda Loop and Apollo Circle aren’t just happy coincidences. They reflect UCF’s beginnings as a space university.</p>
							<p>And they’re not the only UCF connection that’s out of this world. In 1968, our first president, Charles Millican, established the motto “Reach for the Stars” to represent the university’s promising aerospace education in engineering, electronics and other technological professions. The theme continued with his presentation of the university’s seal, Pegasus, which was intended to “bridge the gap between the humanities and space technology.”</p>
							<p>It was the height of space exploration in America, so given the university’s proximity to Kennedy Space Center (KSC), it meant our then-little campus would be a big part of educating future generations of NASA engineers, administrators and even astronauts. And our connections to space have continued to grow over the past 53 years.</p>

							<h2>1968</h2>
							<h3>Galactic Grants</h3>
							<p>In 1968, UCF received its first research grant — $12,500 from NASA. Nearly 45 years later, NASA helped UCF make history again by awarding the single largest grant in the university’s history, $55 million, to fund the GOLD mission. The GOLD mission will build and launch an instrument that will provide unprecedented imaging of Earth’s upper atmosphere, also making UCF the first Florida university to lead a satellite mission for NASA. To date, UCF has received more than $124 million in space-related research grants.</p>

							<p><strong>1968 NASA Grant</strong> $12.5K</p>

							<h3>Model Mascot</h3>
							<p>FTU’s first suggested mascot paired Florida’s citrus and space industries, with the introduction of the Citronaut — a character with an astronaut’s head and an orange for a body — which made its debut on the cover of the 1968-69 Student Handbook.</p>
