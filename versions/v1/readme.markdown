# Pegasus Version 1 (v1) | DEPRECATED

Functions, templates and assets used in issues from Summer 2012 thru Fall 2013.

These files are *required* for displaying stories and issue covers that fall under this version and should NOT be removed.  **Modifying files in this version is not recommended without extensive testing of each affected story and issue.**

Stories created under this issue were written before we started using story and issue templates; therefore, all stories are custom and depend heavily on the assets from this version.

Version 1 should NOT be assigned to new issues.  New issues should always use the newest version files available.
